SSH keypair generated by assistant for Hostinger deployment testing.

Files created:
- id_ed25519         : private key (KEEP PRIVATE!)
- id_ed25519.pub     : public key (safe to add to server's authorized_keys)

Usage:
1) Add the public key content of `id_ed25519.pub` to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your Hostinger account (user `u570718221`).
   Example (on Hostinger server):

   mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   echo "<paste-the-public-key-line-here>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

2) From your local machine, connect using the private key (copy `id_ed25519` to your local `~/.ssh/` and set permissions to 600):

   scp -P 65002 deploy/ssh_keys/id_ed25519 u570718221@82.25.125.174:~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   # or copy manually via a secure channel

   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 65002 u570718221@82.25.125.174

Security notes:
- DO NOT share the private key (`id_ed25519`) publicly.
- Prefer generating keypair on *your* machine instead of transferring private keys.
- After I finish (or after any debugging), delete this key from the server and rotate keys.

If you want, I can also:
- Produce a single short command you can paste on Hostinger to add the public key automatically (you will still need to run it on the server), or
- Walk you through adding the key now and then proceed with the automated setup steps.
